# Bidirectional RNN, LSTM, and GRU Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing **Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** architectures using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

The notebook demonstrates:
- Building and training each model
- Comparing their performance
- Understanding the advantages of different RNN variants
